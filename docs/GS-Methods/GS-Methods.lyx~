\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Genomic selection (GS) promises to accelerate the rate of genetic gain in
 plant breeding for genetically complex traits, including yield, by selecting
 individuals of high breeding value earlier in the breeding cycle.

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The GS approach is novel in that it simultaneously estimates 
\series bold
all genome-wide marker effects
\series default
 to predict an individual’s genomic estimated breeding value (
\series bold

), contrary to estimate marker effects based on their level of significance
 (e.g MAS).

As the cost and efficiency of obtaining genomic information on plants (or
 animals) below the cost and efficiency of evaluating individuals over years

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
GS-based cycle time may be reduced to one or two years from the traditional

GS:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
One of the greatest potential advantages of GS is its ability to identify
 individuals with higher breeding values without the requirement of collecting
 phenotypes pertaining to those individuals.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It has been shown that selection of individuals based on GEBV can substantially
 increase the rate of genetic gain in plant breeding compared to traditional
 marker-assisted selection (MAS) or phenotypic selection.

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
GS prediction models are developed using a 
\series bold
training population
\series default
 consisting of individuals with both genome-wide marker 
\series bold
genotypes and phenotypes
\series default
 of interest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
These individuals are used to train a model by simultaneously estimating
 the contribution of marker effects to their phenotypic value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
GS models utilize information gathered from the training population 
\series bold
to estimate a breeding value and predict
\series default
 the performance of breeding lines without phenotypes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Dense marker coverage is needed in order to maximize the number of QTL in
 linkage disequilibrium (LD) with at least one marker, thereby maximizing
 the number of QTL effects captured by the molecular markers.

problem:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
With a large number of genetic markers there will often be more effects
 to be estimated than there are phenotypic data points for which to estimate
 them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It is a concern for GS as it can cause over-fitting of the model which exaggerat
es minor fluctuations in the data and is due to collinearity between markers
 (Lorenz et al., 2011).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This creates a model that is highly accurate when evaluating the training
 population but has poor predictive ability when applied to a different
 test population.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Research has shown that GS models have diminishing returns for additional
 markers once the populations have reached the point of ‘marker saturation’.

Composition

of_training_populatio:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
One of the most important factors in developing a GS model is the composition
 of individuals included in the training population set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Prediction accuracies are maximized when the training population and the
 test population (selection candidates) are closely related.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
More closely related individuals share a common ancestry fewer generations
 back, and, therefore, fewer opportunities for recombination between markers
 and QTL, thus preserving QTL-marker linkage phases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Several studies have shown that training population size has a greater impact
 on GS prediction accuracy than marker number, with a smaller training populatio
n size having a strong negative effect on GS prediction accuracy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Studies have shown that combining genotypes from 
\series bold
multiple populations
\series default
 in order to create a 
\series bold
larger training population
\series default
 results in 
\series bold
higher prediction

 accuracies than analysing individual populations with fewer genotypes in

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The GS concept encompasses a broad range of methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Their common feature is to estimate the breeding values of individuals for
 quantitative traits using whole genome genotypes through the simultaneous
 estimation of marker effects in a single step
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
With the increased popularity of GS in plant breeding, numerous models have
 been proposed:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
X is a design matrix, allocating records to genotypes for m markers (number
 or records x m) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
g is a vector of the effects of the m markers 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
e is a vector of random residuals, assumed normally distributed, variance
 
\begin_inset Formula $σ\text{²}_{e}$

\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Makes the assumption that markers are random effects having nonzero effects
 with equal marker variance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This assumption does not mean the effects of all markers are equal, rather,
 they are all equally shrunk toward zero
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
By shrinking all marker effects to the same degree and including all markers
 in the model, the use of RR-BLUP is 
\series bold
best suited for traits controlled by many loci with small effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Bayesian
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

models:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Bayesian models address the simple but likely unrealistic assumptions that
 all markers have nonzero effects and that markers have equal variance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Bayesian models relax these two assumptions and better model marker effects
 of differing sizes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Bayesian models estimate a separate variance for each marker, and the variances
 are assumed to follow a specified prior distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
BayesA:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Allow variance toward zero, but did not permit the value of zero itself
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Description

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Allows markers to have a variance of zero.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Description

RR-Blup:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Bayesian methods outperformed RR-BLUP through better estimation of large-effect
 QTL by allowing for unequal variances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Studies show only slight differences between their accuracies (RR-BLUP,
 BayesA, BayesB, and BayesCπ).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Studies concluded that GS accuracy was not strongly influenced by model
 choice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
One of the draw backs of the Bayesian approach is its computational complexity
 which results in long run times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Computational complexity has led many researchers and breeders to rely on
 the RR-BLUP model.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Description
The
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

best
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

approach:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The best approach for using molecular markers in GS largely depends on the
 genetic architecture of the trait
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For a given number of markers (
\begin_inset Formula $N_{M}$
\end_inset

), RR-BLUP assumes that each marker accounts for 
\begin_inset Formula $(\frac{1}{N_{M}})^{th}$
\end_inset

 of the total genetic variation (
\begin_inset Formula $V_{G}$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If one of the markers corresponds to a known 
\series bold
major gene
\series default
, the 
\series bold
assumption of common variance
\series default
 for the known major gene leads to an 
\series bold
underestimation
\series default
 of the estimated effects of the major gene.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An alternative to the modelling all genes as random effects with equal variance
 is to 
\series bold
model known major genes or QTLs as fixed effects
\series default
 in a model with genome-wide markers as random effects.

major
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

genes:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
RR-BLUP models with fixed effects of major genes were shown to provide greater
 GS prediction accuracy when trait heritability was high and a large percentage
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{G}$
\end_inset

 was explained by the major genes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It was also shown that as the 
\series bold
number of training population individuals decreased
\series default
, it became more advantageous 
\series bold
to consider major genes as fixed effects
\series default
 rather than random effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
These results were consistent whether there was a single major gene or whether
 there were multiple major genes 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Although treating a major gene as a fixed effect can increase GS prediction
 accuracy, using a major gene as a fixed effect puts a stronger selection
 pressure on the major gene which can lead to more drastic changes in gene
 frequency
