SeqBreed:
- A generic and flexible forward simulator
- GP can be difficult to implement when exist uncertainty about the genetic basis of complex traits.
- SeqBreed takes genotype/sequence data from a founder population and simulates phenotypes according to a predetermined genetic architecture.

DeepLearning in GS:
-  A potential advantage of DL for GP over standard linear model methods is that DL can potentially take into account all
genetic interactions, including dominance and epistasis, which are expected to be of special relevance in most polyploids
